                    <p style="font-size: 30px">
                        During Week one I started grabbing data from echonest using a python script. In my initial run I grab
                        all the available genres that echonest had on their servers. Once I had the genres I went through each
                        genre and grab list of 100 artist at a time. From each genre I was able to grab 900 artist. This process took about 3 to 4 days to get done.
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="font-size: 35px">Week 2</h4>
                    <p style="font-size: 30px">
                        In the second week grab data that was going to be used for the top 10 artist for each decade. I ended creating another python script to grab this data. The inital idea that
                        group agreed upon was to used the data I grabbed to put it into a database.This idea was later scrapped to have the data localized into the website itself.
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="font-size: 35px">Week 3</h4>
                    <p style="font-size: 30px">
                        During week three, I took the existing data that I had to create a list for the top 10 genres. I how I did this was to first sort the list of artist that I had by genre and year, I than ran a python
                        script that would caculate median of the hotttness rating for each artist. In my script it also counted the number of artist that was in a particualar genre. Initally I was going to use the hottness to
                        to find the top 10 for decade. One thing that noticed in my data was genres that didn't exist in particular time periods and I ended going by the number of artist. There were artist who existed in certain
                        time period but were claimed under genre that did not exist yet.
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="font-size: 35px">Week 4</h4>
                    <p style="font-size: 30px"> In the final week of the project I started creating the timeline that we ended up using in visualization. For the time I used the data that got from processing the artist list to get a list of the
                        top 10 per decade. During that week I added the basic c functions to the timeline that allowed it highlight information.
