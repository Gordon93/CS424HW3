                    Using this application we found quite a few Interesting things such as that jazz and classical music were the most popular genres early in the 20th century.</br> As the century went a long rock and pop became the more popular genre.</br> Most famous artist sang in English and came from the United Sates, UK , Australia or India.</br>
            </br>
    </br>
            Overall most famous artist are based in the West and sing in English which is essential to gaining popularity. We were surprised to see that there were little to non Chinese,Spanish,Arabic  singers since these are 3 of the most widely spoken languages with a big audience/market. 
</br>

As a local connection we were glad to learn that Chicago blues played an important role in the history of music and defining future genres. We see that big cities such as Chicago, New York, London are the home of some of the most successful artist.
